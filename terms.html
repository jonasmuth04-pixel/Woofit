    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Woofit ("the App"), developed by Jonas Muth, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Woofit is a pet health tracking application that allows you to log and monitor your dog's health information, including weight, symptoms, meals, medications, activities, and vet visits. The App syncs data across your Apple devices using iCloud (CloudKit).</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
    <p>The App offers a free tier with limited functionality and a paid subscription ("Woofit Pro") that unlocks additional features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID account via the App Store.</li>
        <li>Subscription plans automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renewal at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device's Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their App Store refund policies.</li>
        <li>Prices may change with advance notice. Continued use after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new price.</li>
        <li>No refunds are provided for partial subscription periods upon cancellation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Free Trial</h2>
    <p>If a free trial is offered, it will convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the trial expires. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited upon purchasing a subscription.</p>

    <h2>No Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for informational and tracking purposes only. Nothing in the App constitutes veterinary or medical advice. The toxic food guide, health logs, and any other information provided by the App are for general reference and should not replace professional veterinary consultation.</p>
    <p>Always consult a qualified veterinarian for questions about your pet's health, diet, or treatment. Jonas Muth and Woofit are not liable for any decisions made based on information presented in the App.</p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The accuracy of data you enter into the App.</li>
        <li>Maintaining the security of your Apple ID and iCloud account.</li>
        <li>Any content, including photos, that you store within the App.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that shared dog profiles are only shared with people you trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the App's functionality.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, design, graphics, trademarks, and intellectual property within the App are owned by Jonas Muth and are protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any part of the App without prior written consent.</p>
    <p>The data you enter into the App remains yours. We claim no ownership over your personal content.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Jonas Muth does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Jonas Muth shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for violations of these terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately, though your data stored in iCloud remains subject to Apple's policies.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms of Service at any time. Changes will be reflected within the App with an updated revision date. Your continued use of the App after modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us through the App Store listing for Woofit.</p>
