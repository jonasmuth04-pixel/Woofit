    <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

    <p>This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and Jonas Muth ("Developer") for the use of Woofit ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
    <p>The Developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on any Apple device that you own or control, subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of License</h2>
    <p>This license does not allow you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distribute, sublicense, lease, rent, or lend the App to third parties.</li>
        <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>Copy, modify, or create derivative works of the App or its content.</li>
        <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices.</li>
        <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers auto-renewing subscription plans ("Woofit Pro") that provide access to premium features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account upon confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your device Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions.</li>
        <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
        <li>Prices are in your local currency and may vary by region.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Content</h2>
    <p>The data you enter into the App (including dog profiles, health logs, photos, and notes) remains your property. The Developer does not claim ownership over any user-generated content. Your data is stored in your private iCloud account via Apple CloudKit.</p>

    <h2>5. No Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for informational and tracking purposes only. It does not provide veterinary or medical advice. The toxic food guide, health recommendations, and any other information are for general reference only. Always consult a qualified veterinarian for questions about your pet's health.</p>

    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for information on how we handle your data. The App does not collect analytics, does not contain advertising, and does not share data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple CloudKit for data synchronization and Apple StoreKit for in-app purchases. Your use of these services is subject to Apple's terms and conditions. The Developer is not responsible for the availability or performance of third-party services.</p>

    <h2>8. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE APP.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete all copies from your devices.</p>

    <h2>11. Apple's Role</h2>
    <p>You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and the Developer only, not with Apple. Apple is not responsible for the App or its content. Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple for a refund of the purchase price (if applicable); Apple has no other warranty obligation. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App. Apple is a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce it against you.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Agreement</h2>
    <p>The Developer reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. Changes will be reflected with an updated revision date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Agreement.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
